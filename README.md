# HW3 - Corey Sarazin

I am enjoying this project so far, and I am currently at the point where I feel as if I fully understand the needs of the project and I can now start to write a lot of code. I am working solo on this project, and I will be taking a lot of time over the thanksgiving break to get the implementation working. I currently do not have an SSH key to test the code but I will be working in the following days to have code to test my implementation immediately when that problem gets resolved. I was unable to complete a lot of coding itself in the past week and a half because I have been working on another final project that was due last week, but I now have more time to contribute to this project, and I am not concerned about my progress so far or my ability to get the project done.
